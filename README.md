Hello,
This is an extended example of Lexical Text Editor.
I tried to add here " Undo, Redo, Bold, Italic, Underline, Strike, 4 types of alignment, and 3 types of List Elements"

I used these packages bellow,

    "@lexical/list": "^0.16.0",
    
    "@lexical/react": "^0.16.0",
    
    "@lexical/rich-text": "^0.16.0",
    
 

===============================================================


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
